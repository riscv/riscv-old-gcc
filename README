This is the RISC-V C and C++ cross-compiler. It supports two build modes:
a generic ELF/Newlib toolchain and a more sophisticated Linux-ELF/glibc
toolchain.  The latter is also the basis for the RISC-V Akaros cross-
compiler, which is kept separately in the Akaros repository.

To build the Newlib cross-compiler, pick an install path.  If you choose,
say, /opt/riscv-gcc, then add /opt/riscv-gcc/bin to your PATH now.  Then,
simply run the following command:

 % ./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv-gcc
 % make

You should now be able to use riscv-gcc and its cousins.


To build the Linux cross-compiler, riscv-linux-gcc:

 % ./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv-linux-gcc
 % make linux
